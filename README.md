**Paperclip is a visual programming language that offers a hybrid approach for creating web apps.** It comes with a UI builder that you can use to visually create UIs, and a readable file format that you can easily edit by hand.

### Invite everyone on your team build UIs 👨🏻‍🎨

No more needing to ask developers to make HTML and CSS changes, Paperclip enables anyone to make changes themselves using the UI builder. Marketers, designers, copywriters, whoever. Invite everyone to build UIs, and ship things faster than ever!

### Use Paperclip in your existing app

Paperclip is designed to work with your existing codebase. Just import Paperclip files like so:

```typescript
import { TodoItem } from "./todo-item.pc";

<TodoItem />

// show "done" variation
<TodoItem className="done" />
```

Easy peasy!
