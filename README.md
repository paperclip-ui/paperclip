**Paperclip is a visual programming language that offers a hybrid approach for creating web apps.** It comes with a UI builder that you can use to visually create UIs, and a readable file format that you can easily edit by hand.

### Invite everyone on your team build UIs 👨🏻‍🎨

No more needing to ask developers to make HTML and CSS changes, **Paperclip enables anyone to make changes themselves using the UI builder**. Marketers, designers, copywriters, whoever. Invite everyone to build UIs, and ship things faster than ever!

### Use Paperclip in your existing app

Paperclip is designed to work with your existing codebase. Just import Paperclip files like so:

```typescript
import { TodoItem } from "./todo-item.pc";

<TodoItem />

// show "done" variation
<TodoItem className="done" />
```

Easy peasy!

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind Paperclip is to enable _anyone_ to create UIs in an easy-ish way that's also safe and scalable.
