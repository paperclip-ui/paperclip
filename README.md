Paperclip is a visual programming language that offers a hybrid approach for creating web apps. Build apps visually, or write them by hand. Pick whatever medium that suites you and your team!

### Invite everyone on your team build UIs üë®üèª‚Äçüé®

### Use Paperclip in your existing app

Paperclip is designed to work with your existing codebase. Just import Paperclip files like so:

```typescript
import { TodoItem } from "./todo-item.pc";

<TodoItem />

// show "done" variation
<TodoItem className="done" />
```

Easy peasy!

<!--

## Why the hybrid approach?
## Why use Paperclip?

Paperclip is intended to make it easier and faster for anyone to contribute to UI development, and in the same codebase. Why is this special?

- Everything is saved in GIT
- UI changes go through the same CI / CD pipeline
- UI changes are easy to code review -->

## Development setup

The develeopment tooling enables you to compile design files into application code (currently supporting vanilla React, HTML, and vanilla CSS). To get started, run the following command:

```sh
# TODO SH installation command
npx @paperclip-ui/cli init
```

This will run through the installation process for your project. After that, you can start using Paperclip locally with your existing codebase.

## CLI Usage

You can use the CLI tool to compile and edit design files locally. Here are some example commands:

```sh
# Build all paperclip files
paperclip build

# Open the paperclip designer in a browser for visual development
paperclip designer
```

## Contributing

Right now, the _main_ focus for the app is around the designer UI and UX. If you're a designer and would like to help out with that, awesome! The main thing that would be super helpful is to come up with suggestions and / or design around how to improve the designer to better suite your workflow.

You're welcome to use the designer, Figma, or any tool to submit suggestions. If they're accepted, we'll wire up your designs and include the new functionality in the designer.

## Roadmap

There are a number of things on the horizon for Paperclip, not in order:

- Visual regression coverage of all UI
- Import directly from Figma
- More compiler targets
  - Various frameworks: Svelte, Vue
  - Various design systems: MaterialUI, Radix, Chakra, etc.
  - More language: PHP, Java, Ruby, etc.
- Ability to build and deploy apps built in Paperclip
- More platform targets like iOS, Android (this is a big maybe)
