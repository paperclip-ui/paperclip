### Considerations

- Try not to hand-write any new UI unless it's necessary for self-creation
- It's all important so do what makes sense immediately

- What's 0-1 look like?

  - slots
  - style panel
    - mixins
    - variants
  - properties
    - ability to define class
  - ability to convert element to component
  - ability to insert instances

- 1+

  - ability to re-organize slots
  - style overrides

- How does the designer incentivize the app structure?

#### Warm up (30 min)

- split legacy reducer code

Easy wins:

- ability to rename layers

#### On-deck

- ability to insert elements into slots
- ability to move elements around in the layers panel
- styles panel
- style overrides
