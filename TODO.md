#### Milestone 1: parser

- get dependency graph done
  - make it async
- scan entire dependency graph
- use threads for parser

#### Milestone 2: evaluator

#### Milestone 3: compiler

- React-based compiler
- vanilla compiler for CSS

- Consider _not_ building a CSS parser and using _computed_ state instead.

- Rust engine

  - parser

    - use struct parser
    - expressions
      - styles
        - variants
        - targets
    - ensure that style declarations work
      - css varaibles need to work
    - update variant syntax
    - styles
      - declare mixins
      - include mixins (extends)
      - variants

  - evaluator
    - should render virtual DOM
  - translator
    - interim
  - inspector
  - CLI
  - FE engine in Rust?

- save entire graph
- Rust rendering engine
- migrate over to AST instead of DSL
- start upgrading UI
- rust packages

```

```
