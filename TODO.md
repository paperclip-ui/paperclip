#### On-deck

- realtime changes between VS Code and preview
  - need to store contents in a "virtual" palce
  - look into how this can be done collaboratively
- VLS
  - color picker
- TD UI

#### Milestone: MVP UI

Minimum number of things to get to polished state of entire UI

- right panel
- left panel
  - file navigator
  -
- canvas
  - just preview

#### Milestone: UI Feedback

#### Milestone: Wire up UI

#### Considerations

- loading PC files from other packages
  - resolve path of compiled output
    - this only works if compile targets are the same, so we'll need to check
- possibly use grid view for components instead of file system?

#### Milestone: online editing

- should be able to navigate to designer online
- pick any PC file
