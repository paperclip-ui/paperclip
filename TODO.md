#### Immediate

- Style panel
  - ability to add another prop (+ button and tab)
  - ability to clear declarations
  - color picker




### Considerations

- Try not to hand-write any new UI unless it's necessary for self-creation
- It's all important so do what makes sense immediately

### Litmus

- Can update any element in the editor

#### Warm up (30 min)

- split legacy reducer code

Easy wins:

- ability to rename layers

#### On-deck

- slots

  - use expr id to find virt node Ids and calc box around that

- ability to insert elements into slots
- ability to move elements around in the layers panel
- styles panel (vanilla)
- style overrides
- style tokens
  - mixins
  - atoms

### Polish

- Detach instances when components are deleted
